  <h2><a name="H2">What package Protection does</a></h2>

  <p>This package provides two utilities that can be used
    independently or in conjunction to provide various protection
    paradigms. </p>

  <ul>
    <li>A somewhat evolved semaphore type, used to protect
      ressources from concurrent accesses. </li>
    <li>A procedure to protect a provided procedure from abortion
      (i.e. to guarantee that the user procedure cannot be
      aborted while activated). Protection against concurrent
      accesses to this procedure may also optionnally be
      granted. Variants of this procedure are provided in
      generic packages if a parameter is to be passed to the
      protected procedure. </li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="H2.1">The Semaphore type</a></h3>

  <pre><b>protected type</b> Semaphore<b> is</b>
    <b>entry</b> P;
    <b>procedure</b> V;
    <b>function</b> Holder <b>return</b> Ada.Task_Identification.Task_Id;

    <b>entry</b> Open; 
    --  blocking if Semaphore is closed and still held by another task.
    <b>entry</b> Close;
    --  blocking if Semaphore is open and still held by another task.
    <b>private</b>
    ...
    <b>end</b> Semaphore;

    Closed_Semaphore : <b>exception</b>;
    Semaphore_Error  : <b>exception</b>;</pre>

  <p><code>Semaphore</code> is a protected type with the usual <code>P</code>
    and <code>V</code> procedures: if a task calls <code>P</code>,
    then no other task can proceed through a call to <code>P</code>
    until the first task (the one that owns the semaphore) has called
    the <code>V</code> procedure. It is however a bit more evolved
    than a traditionnal semaphore in several aspects:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The task that currently owns the semaphore <i>may</i>
      call <code>P</code> again without blocking; these calls
      are counted, and the semaphore is released when the
      corresponding number of <code>V</code> have been called.
      This may simplify the writing of procedures that must be
      protected against concurrent execution, while still
      calling each other (a traditionnal semaphore would dead-lock
      in this situation). </li>
    <li>It is possible to close a semaphore (it is initally open).
      Once closed, every task blocked on a <code>P</code>, <i>except
        the one that currently owns the semaphore if any</i>,
      will receive the exception <code>Closed_Semaphore</code>.
      This is also true of any subsequent call to <code>P</code>.
      A closed semaphore can be opened again. If the semaphore
      is currently owned by some other task, <code>Open</code>
      and <code>Close</code> will block until the semaphore is
      free again. On the other hand, the task that currently
      owns the semaphore may open or close it immediately,
      without any effect. The owner may even continue to call <code>P</code>
      (and of course <code>V</code>) without any problem. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>In short, the owner may decide to forbid any further access by
    other tasks to the semaphore by closing it, but will never be
    adversely affected by its own closing until the semaphore is
    released.</p>

  <p>The exception <code>Semaphore_Error</code> is raised when the
    semaphore is incorrectly used, i.e. if <code>V</code> is called
    by a task that does not currently hold the semaphore, or if <code>V</code>
    is called when the semaphore is not busy.</p>

  <h3><a name="H2.2">The Protected_Call procedure</a></h3>

  <pre><b>type</b> Procedure_Access <b>is access procedure</b>;
    <b>type</b> Semaphore_Access <b>is access all</b> Semaphore;
    <b>procedure</b> Protected_Call (Subprogram : Procedure_Access;
    Lock       : Semaphore_Access := <b>null</b>);</pre>

  <p>This procedure is used to call a provided procedure in abort-deferred
    mode, i.e. make sure that the given procedure cannot be aborted.
    Full semantic of the called procedure is preserved, even if an
    exception is raised.</p>

  <p>If an access to a <code>Semaphore</code> object is given as
    the second parameter, the whole call is protected by a <code>P</code>/<code>V</code>
    pair, i.e. it will also be protected from concurrent access by
    several tasks. Note that the same semaphore object can be given
    to several <code>Protected_Call</code>, even with different
    procedures. This allows to make sure that all the procedures are
    executed in mutual exclusion.</p>

  <h3><a name="H2.3">The Generic_Protected_Call package</a></h3>

  <pre><b>generic</b>
    <b>type</b> Parameter_Type (&lt;&gt;) <b>is private</b>;
    <b>package</b> Generic_Protected_Call <b>is</b>
    <b>type</b> Parametered_Procedure_Access <b>is access procedure</b> (Item : Parameter_Type);
    <b>procedure</b> Protected_Call (Subprogram : Parametered_Procedure_Access;
    Parameter  : Parameter_Type;
    Lock       : Semaphore_Access := <b>null</b>);        
    <b>private</b>
    ...
    <b>end</b> Generic_Protected_Call;</pre>

  <p>This generic allows to provide the same functionnality as the <code>Protected_Call</code>
    procedure described above, but when the called procedure needs
    one argument. The formal type parameter gives the type of the
    argument to the procedure.</p>

  <p>Note that if more than one parameter is needed, you can simply
    stuff them into a record type and pass it as a single parameter (provided
    no parameter is unconstrained or limited). If you need a limited
    parameter, use <code>Generic_Limited_Protected_Call</code> (described
    next). Otherwise, we suggest that you make a specialized version
    of <code>Protected_Call</code> that suits your needs. This should
    be very straightforward by adapting the procedures from this
    package.</p>

  <h3><a name="H2.4">The Generic_Limited_Protected_Call package</a></h3>

  <pre><b>generic</b>
    <b>type</b> Parameter_Type (&lt;&gt;) <b>is limited private</b>;
    <b>package</b> Generic_Limited_Protected_Call <b>is</b>
    <b>type</b> Parametered_Procedure_Access <b>is access procedure</b> (Item : Parameter_Type);
    <b>procedure</b> Protected_Call (Subprogram : Parametered_Procedure_Access;
    Parameter  : <b>access</b> Parameter_Type;
    Lock       : Semaphore_Access := <b>null</b>);        
    <b>private</b>
    ...
    <b>end</b> Generic_Limited_Protected_Call;</pre>

  <p>This package works exactly like the previous one, but allows
    the parameter type to be a limited type. The price to pay is that
    the parameter must be given to the <code>Protected_Call</code>
    procedure as an access value, therefore needing aliasing etc.
    Admitedly, whether you should prefer this one or the other one is
    a matter of need for limitedness and taste...</p>

  <h3><a name="H2.5">Questions and answers</a></h3>

  <p><b>Q: </b>Why use <code>Protected_Call</code> rather than a
    protected type?<br>
    <b>A: </b>Of course, the simplest way of protecting code from
    abortion is to put it into a protected operation. However, there
    are a number of things (including IOs) that are not allowed in a
    protected operation: the so-called <i>potentially blocking
      operations</i>. On the other hand, there is no limitation to what
    can be put in a procedure protected by <code>Protected_Call</code>.
    Note also that it is possible to get protection against abortion
    without serialization, which is not possible with protected
    operations. </p>

  <p><b>Q: </b>I want to pass a subprocedure of the main program to
    <code>Protected_Call</code>, but the compiler refuses the 'Access.<br>
    <b>A: </b>Since the type <code>Procedure_Access</code> is
    declared in a library package, only library procedures or
    procedures declared at the outermost level of a library package
    can be passed to <code>Protected_Call</code>. See the rules on
    accessibility levels. </p>

  <p><b>Q: </b>Why does the compiler refuse to instantiate the
    generic packages from within the main program?<br>
    <b>A: </b>The generic packages use controlled types, and can
    therefore be instantiated <i>only</i> as library packages, or
    inside library packages. </p>

  <p><b>Q: </b>Where can I find examples of uses of this package?<br>
    <b>A: </b>Have a look at package <code>Debug</code>, also
    available from <a href="http://www.adalog.fr/compo2">Adalog's
      components page</a>. Actually, the need for package <code>Protection</code>
    appeared when designing <code>Debug</code>, and we decided later
    to make it a software component of its own. </p>

  <h2><a name="H3">Implementation notes</a></h2>

  <p>This section gives additionnal details about the
    implementation technique of package <code>Protection</code>. We
    recommend that you first have a look at the implementation of <code>Protection</code>
    before reading this section. YOU DO NOT NEED TO UNDERSTAND (not
    even read) THIS SECTION IN ORDER TO USE THE PACKAGE.</p>

  <h3>The semaphore</h3>

  <p>The semaphore is a quite straightforward protected type. The
    only problem we encountered is that we wanted to block or not,
    depending on the calling task; however, the <code>'Caller</code>
    attribute cannot be used in the guard of a protected entry. We
    solved it by having a public entry with a <code>True</code> guard
    which checks the condition, and requeues to a private entry if
    the condition is not met. This technique can be used each time a
    condition is necessary, which for some reason is too complicated
    to put as a regular guard.</p>

  <h3>The Protected_Call</h3>

  <p>The whole trick for making a call unabortable without
    protected types is to issue it from a <code>Finalize</code>,
    since finalization is an abort deferred operation (see RM 9.8(10)).
    However, a finalizable type (and its <code>Finalize</code>) has
    to be declared directly in a library package. How could the <code>Finalize</code>
    be passed the pointer to the procedure to call? The trick was to
    use an access-to-procedure discriminant in the controlled type (<code>Anti_Abort_Object</code>)
    whose finalization performs the call. Similarly, the (possible)
    semaphore is passed as another discriminant.</p>

  <p>At this point, the functionnality could seem sufficient.
    However, if the called procedure raised an exception, it would
    propagate out of the <code>Finalize</code>, resulting in a
    bounded error (extremely bounded however, since it always results
    in the raising of <code>Program_Error</code>, RM 7.6.1(14..24)).
    Of course, we could have required the called procedure not to
    raise any exception, but we found that it was actually possible
    to preserve the full semantics of the original exception. The
    trick was to add another discriminant which is a pointer to an
    object of type <code>Exception_Occurrence</code>. If an exception
    is raised, it is caught in the <code>Finalize</code> (to prevent
    propagation), but the occurrence is saved. After the
    finalization, <code>Protected_Call</code> reraises the occurrence.
    And if no exception occurs ? The <code>Exception_Occurrence</code>
    object is initialized to <code>Null_Occurrence</code>, and the RM
    explicitely states (RM 11.4.1(14) that raising a <code>Null_Occurrence</code>
    does nothing, so it's OK.</p>

  <p>The generic versions work exactly like the non-generic one,
    with the addition of another access discriminant to pass the
    parameter value to the called procedure. Note however that it is
    not allowed to take directly the <code>'Access</code> of a formal
    parameter. In the non-limited version, we copy the parameter to
    an (aliased) local object; in the limited version, we require the
    caller to pass directly an access value.</p>
